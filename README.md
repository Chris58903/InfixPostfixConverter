This program converts infix arithmetic expressions (including variables and multi-digit numbers) into postfix notation, builds a binary expression tree, and evaluates the expression.

Features:
- Supports operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`
- Supports parentheses for grouping
- Handles multi-digit numbers and single-letter variables
- Evaluates expression trees with given variable values

Educational Value:
This project demonstrates basic knowledge of data structures in C++, including:

- Stacks – used for operator precedence handling in infix-to-postfix conversion and for building the expression tree.
- Binary Trees – implemented as a pointer-based expression tree for storing and evaluating expressions.
